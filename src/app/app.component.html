                    <hr />
                    <h3><strong>What's Going On</strong></h3>
                    <li>Angular lacks the global state containers enjoyed by React/Redux, so I coded my own for my
                        team! Using...</li>
                    <li>The Observer Design Pattern: Data is pushed through "Publishers" that then broadcast new values
                        to
                        their
                        "Subscribers" (think action creators, dispatch and reducers in Redux)
                    </li>
                    <hr />
                    <h3><strong>How It Works</strong></h3>
                    <li>Set the MOOD of each family member using the SLIDER.</li>
                    <li>Families rely on each other, so Average Family Happiness effects the individual happiness of
                        each family member, regardless of where they lie in the component hierarchy</li>
                    <hr />
                    <h3><strong>Use Cases</strong></h3>
                    <li>Cross-form validation, scoring systems......</li>
                    <li>Solves the perenial Angular problem of global state with just a few lines of code</li>
                </strong></ul>
